Finally got around to writing the first blog, and maaaaan was it a long time coming trying to set this thing up for my website. But, I finally did something with this heaping junk pile of code that was barely 10 lines of code away from the original `gatsby init default-starter`, so round of applause ladies and gentlemen for the power of Google search and Gatsby's documentation for not being too terrible.

Now, I was thinking for the longest time about what I possibly would want to write about for my very first article; with such tumultuous times and pretty much everything normal in life thrown out the window, pretty much all topics seem to be fair game. Of course, I do realize this endeavor is more for my own sake than for the purposes of building a portfolio of sorts, but nonetheless, one wishes to write interesting things for interesting people, more so than not. Hence, the desire I had to also want to write something _interesting_, and thought provoking.

Yet, putting that all aside, I think the most appropriate way to start these stream of thoughts that I have oh-so accumulated over these past few months can only be started in one way, and they can best be summarized by the defining stage of our lives over the past 4 months of our lives: quarantine. And, indeed, that quarantine has forced everyone to face some harsh, unforgiving facets of life: more specifically, the _monotony_ of life: The drone of everyday living. The utter silence of their thoughts. With that said, the question I've absolutely pondered throughout the course of this pandemic – even in the context of a Christian faith – is as follows:

> ### _What gives my life meaning? And through what lens can the troughs and peaks of life be best interpreted and understood?_

Yes, yes, I do realize this is quite the heavy question to answer, but it's an important one nonetheless, and one that I personally believe so many avoid in the process of living life. Of course, beyond its nebulous nature and difficulty to answer, it also scares those who dare approach it, for oblivion and ignorance is preferrable to facing the hard truths at times.

<!-- One of the lenses through which one can view life is an analogy that seems ever present, yet easily taken for granted and underappreciated, as this is exactly what I did as well, and judging from the title, I'm assuming one can already guess what I'm going to say; running. And not just any type of running, whether it be hurdles, sprnting, 100m dashes, long jump, etc. - I'm talking about running the _distance_.

Running as long and as far and as hard as you can.

Running despite the fact that within the first 5 minutes you already feel somewhat bored and have questioned your original intent for even embarking in the first place. (this is about me in 99% of runs unfortunately) and -->
