# the first one!

#### 7/25/2020

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally got around to writing the first blog, and MAN was it a long time coming
trying to set this thing up for my website, BUT: we're here now, so thank goodness for Google and
Gatsby's documentation for not being too terrible.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I was thinking for the longest time about what I possibly would want to write about for my
very very first article, but honestly, I think it's best to start with the fundamentals of what makes me who I am, and
so I figured I'd address quite the heavy topic for this first one:

> ### _What gives my life meaning? And through what lens can the troughs and peaks of life be best interpreted and understood?_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously a very heavy question, and by no means is this article going to attempt to address how one should approach life
in a definitive or objective manner; that would simply be akin to attempting to write a definitve "manual" to life, assuming that one can always guide
someone to the right decisions in life, etc. But, something I always say is that "if there was always a right answer, wouldn't everyone
be doing the same thing?". In essence, wouldn't we all want to do things the "right" way and hence never deviate from the norm?
I think that thought should at least linger in the back of all of our minds when we always ask for what the "right thing" to do is
(of course, not saying that it's bad to have a moral compass...please, continue to do so to the best of your ability, haha)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do believe that one of the lenses through which one can view life is an analogy that seems ever present,
yet easily taken for granted and underappreciated, as this
is exactly what I did as well, and judging from the title, I'm assuming one can already guess what I'm going to say; running.
And not just any type of running, whether it be hurdles, sprinting, 100m dashes, long jump, etc. - I'm talking about running the _distance_.

Running as long and as far and as hard as you can.

Running despite the fact that within the first 5 minutes you already feel somewhat bored and have questioned your original intent for
even embarking in the first place. (this is about me in 99% of runs unfortunately)

[still in progress...to be continued]
