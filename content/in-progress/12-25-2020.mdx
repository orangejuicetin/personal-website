I write this somewhat as a post-mortem, as it's now Christmas day and I sit here writing and reflecting, finding these drafts stuck in my "in-progress" folder because I guess I never got around to actually writing down what I was feeling at the time (rip school work and just life in general). However, with a clearer head and a far more free schedule, I guess it's better that I write from this perspective to ask my self how these past few months have gone, and because I've failed to really output much writing in the past few months, I guess this post serves as an amalgam of thoughts and reflections from various points in the semester all combined into one.

For starters, I think that in August before the semester started I was amazed at how much God provided, even in the midst of a pandemic; the fact that I was still able to do all to start all these different habits while still being blessed with some friends in Philly was truly amazing, whether it was running (for a more in-depth perspective, look no further than my <StyledInternalLink to="/content/posts/7-28-2020" color={theme.colors.orange[1]}> previous </StyledInternalLink> blog post), being more consistent with reading the Word, keeping in contact with friends from RCF and beyond thanks to the powers of Zoom (despite game nights getting reallll old realll quick), learning how to somewhat consistently cook (many Trader Joe's groceries nonetheless went bad due to my lack of diligence, F in the chat), or helping make Ampe with a bunch of super dope people I can now call my friends, there's still so much I can't fully remember from this past summer that I'm truly grateful for.

Then, with the start of school came this wave of abnormality truly setting in; at least in the past spring semester we at least had the privilege of starting classes in person and running into friends or acquaintances in the lecture halls, asking how their break had been and why they were taking the class. But no longer, as this fall having to meet everyone for the first time through a screen just led to one awkward intro after another. And of course, the first semester that I actually have multiple small, seminar-eqsue courses that, in person, would provide an intimate learning setting with a ton of interaction with the professor, it's online and I can barely connect with any of my peers, much less my instructors who were trying so hard to at least create some semblance of a normal college classroom. The effort was appreciated, but by and large fell short of what we felt our college experience should have been.
